## 🧠 About Me

I specialize in building reliable relational database environments focused on performance, availability, and security.

I don’t just build dashboards —  
I design complete database systems, optimize queries under load, simulate failures, and implement measurable improvements in speed and reliability.

## 🎯 Engineering Philosophy

• Prevent failures before they happen  
• Measure performance, don’t assume  
• Automate repetitive processes  
• Design for scalability  
• Optimize for reliability  

Databases are not storage —  
They are the backbone of scalable systems.
